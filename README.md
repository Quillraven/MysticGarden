# MysticGarden
hobby project with libgdx to create a small puzzle like game that will be later used for a youtube tutorial series.
The project will use ashley, box2d, tiled, truetypefont and scene2d

# TODOs

* Save/Load (for continue logic, new game -> clear map info from preferences)
  * save when GameScreen gets hidden (or disposed?)
* GameView: on mobile add button to go back to menu; on other devices just press ESC
  * add this info to ControlsScreen
* update README in general with screenshots
