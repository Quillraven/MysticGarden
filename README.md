# Mystic Garden

Mystic Garden is a hobby project with LibGDX to create a small
puzzle like game. The game is used as a foundation for a Java based
[YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vOTrSD5lDA&list=PLTKHCDn5RKK-seXZveiSQuSXkLq3wBYn1).

The Java project uses:
- Ashley ECS
- Box2D
- Box2D Light
- Tiled
- Truetype font
- Scene2D

### Story

As a player you control a hero who wakes up in a dark mystical garden.
You lost your girl and need to find her! A magical portal in the garden
seems to be the solution but to activate it you need to collect all
crystals which are hidden in the different areas of the garden.
